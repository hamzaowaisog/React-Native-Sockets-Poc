# Recordings (testing)

Audio segments sent by the client are saved here by the server when you run `yarn server`.

- Files are named: `segment_<id>_image_<index>_<clientId>.m4a`
- Play with any media player (e.g. QuickTime, VLC) to verify recording.

This folder is gitignored so generated audio is not committed. Remove `recordings/` from `.gitignore` if you want to commit sample files.
